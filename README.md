# expenditure-data-analysis

This is just basic analysis and the data-set for the personal expenditure data. It includes "spendings_final.csv" for the data-set and "analysed_data.ipynb" for the analysis on python. Also it includes "DataProcesses_diary.docx" for quick summary on what I thought in the process of creating and analysing the data-set.

Feel free to use the data-set or the pyhton codes!
